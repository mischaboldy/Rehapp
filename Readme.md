# Rehapp

Rehapp is a conceptual prototype for a rehabilitation app. It was made to show what the end product could or should look like.

## Prototype

Since this is only a conceptual prototype, many functions don't actualy work and are not intended to do so. Use this work only as an idea or concept for a future product.

My prototype is the first step in a process of designing and building an application that will eventually help patients of trauma rehabilitate, by motivating them to keep moving and showing them their process.


### Disclaimer

This is my first android application. So I'm guessing it contains plenty of flaws and rule violations.
