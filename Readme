This is my first ever android application. Therefor it is submitted to plenty of flawes and unwritten rule violations.
Rehapp is a conceptual prototype for a rehabillitation app. It was made to show what the end product could or should look like.
Since this is only a conceptual prototype, many functions don't actualy work and are not intended to do so. Use this work only as an idea or concept for a future product.
My prototype is the first step in a process of designing and building an application that will eventually help patients of trauma rehabilitate, by motivating them to keep moving and showing them their process.
